      -- Brief Aside: **What is LSP?**
      --
      -- LSP is an acronym you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.
      --
      -- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
      -- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
      --
      -- In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
      -- language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc). These Language Servers
      -- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
      -- processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
      --
      -- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
      --  - Go to definition
      --  - Find references
      --  - Autocompletion
      --  - Symbol Search
      --  - and more!
      --
      -- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
      -- Neovim. This is where `mason` and related plugins come into play.
